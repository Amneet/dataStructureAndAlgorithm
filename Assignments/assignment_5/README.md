```
1. A+B-C
2. (A+B)*(C-D)$E*F
3. (A+B)*(C$(D-E)+F)-G
4. A+(((B-C)*(D-E)+F)/G)$(H-J)
```

#####Transform each of the following prefix expressions to infix
```
1. +-ABC
2. +A-BC
3. ++A-*$BCDI +EF*GHI

2. ABC+*CBA-+*
```

#####Create a table and convert the following infix to postfix
```

```

#####MISSING GAP "THIS QUESTION SHOULD BE STRICTLY DONE"
