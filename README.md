####Laboratory works: 
___This course requires a lot of programming practices. Each topic must be followed by a practical session. Some practical sessions include programming to:___
```
• Write a code to multiply two matrixes and get the transpose of the third one.
• Write a code to implement the stack, that should check overflow and underflow also.
• Write a code to convert any prefix number to postfix.
• Write a code to convert any infix number to postfix.
• Write a code to convert any post fix number to prefix.
• Implement tower of Hanoi.
• Write a code to implement different sorting techniques.
• Write a code to demonstrate the binary search.
• Write a code to implement the queue.
• Write a code to convert stack operation to queue operation.
